# egsnrc-thesis-etl
Automation script I wrote for my undergraduate thesis. A default installation of the egs_chamber tool from the EGSnrc toolkit does not outright support multiple sequential simulations. I needed simulations with varying electron source energies and localization so I wrote BASH and Python scripts that did this for me. It involves the creation of the simulation geometries up to the creating of organized datasets containing the S-values. 

## How to use
Simply copy the files into `egs_chamber/`
